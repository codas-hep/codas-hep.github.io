  The second school on tools, techniques and methods for Computational
and Data Science for High Energy Physics (CoDaS-HEP) will take place
on 23-27 July, 2018, at Princeton University.

  Advanced software is a critical ingredient to scientific research.
Training young researchers in the latest tools and techniques is
an essential part of developing the skills required for a successful
career both in research and in industry. The CoDaS-HEP school aims
to provide a broad introduction to these critical skills as well
as an overview of applications High Energy Physics. Specific topics
to be covered at the school include:

  Specific Topics to be covered at the school include:

  * Parallel Programming
  * Big Data Tools and Techniques
  * Machine Learning - Technology and Methods
  * Practical skills: performance evaluation, use of git for version control

The program will include both lectures and practical hands-on exercises.

  The 4.5 day school offers a limited number of young researchers an
opportunity to learn these skills from experienced scientists and instructors.
Successful applicants will receive lodging and some level of travel support
to attend the school. Both Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers
are encouraged to apply. Financial support for participants will
be limited to those associated to U.S. academic institutions.

Applications for the CoDaS-HEP school are now being accepted. The
deadline for application is 18 May, 2018. Applicants will be notified
regarding acceptance and available travel support by 25 May.
