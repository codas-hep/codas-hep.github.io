### Guidelines for Reimbursement of Travel Expenses

  The school organization will provide reimbursement for travel expenses for some school participants, up to a specified limit, upon presentation of valid receipts. The following guidelines apply:

  * participants should plan on traveling to Princeton on Sunday, 9 July, 2017 and traveling home on Friday, 14 July, 2017
  * participants should pay for their travel themselves and will be reimbursed up to the specificed limits after the school has finished 
  * the reimbursement can be done by check or bank transfer
  * only the participant can be directly reimbursed (not the participant's research group)
  * reimbursed travel should use the least expensive options possible, which reasonably meet normal travel time constraints
  * reimbursed travel should be booked in regular, economy fares (no business class or paid upgrades can be reimbursed)
  * for long distance ground travel mass transportation (train, bus) is preferred to long distance taxi. If necessary taxi (uber, lyft) can be used for late arrivals in place of the Dinky.
  * receipts should be provided in electronic form (scanned or clear photos), preferably grouped together into a single pdf file with name "codas-hep-<yourlastname>.pdf"
  * a electronic form will be provided to you on the first day of the school to provide information for reimbursement. This should in general be filled out by one week after the end of the school week itself (i.e. Friday, 21 July) and submitted along with the electronic copy of the receipts described above.

  When planning your travel, please remember to take into account not only
any relevant flight to the NJ/NYC area, but also train or other travel to 
arrive at the Princeton campus. Please see the [Travel to Princeton webpage](http://codas-hep.org/pages/travel-princeton.html) for more information.

  If you have any questions or doubts about travel reimbursement please send an email with your travel plan to [codas-hep@googlegroups.com](codas-hep@googlegroups.com) before booking to get confirmation on reimbursement.
