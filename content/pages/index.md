#### The first school on tools, techniques and methods for Computational and Data Science for High Energy Physics (CoDaS-HEP) will take place on 10-13 July, 2017, at Princeton University.

Advanced software is a critical ingredient to scientific research. Training young researchers in the latest tools and techniques is an essential part of developing the skills required for a successful career both in research and in industry.

The CoDaS-HEP school aims to provide a broad introduction to these critical skills as well as an overview of applications High Energy Physics. Specific topics to be covered at the school include:
 
  Specific Topics to be covered at the school include:

  * Parallel Programming 
  * Big Data Tools and Techniques
  * Machine Learning - Technology and Methods
  * Practical skills: performance evaluation, use of git for version control

The school offers a limited number of young researchers an opportunity to learn these skills from experienced scientists and instructors. Successful applicants will receive travel and lodging support to attend the school. Both Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to apply. Financial support for participants will be limited to those associated to U.S. academic institutions.

Applications for the CoDaS-HEP school are now being accepted. The deadline 
for application is 6 June, 2017. Please see the [application webpage](http://codas-hep.org/pages/application.html) for more information.
