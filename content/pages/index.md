#### The first school on tools, techniques and methods for Computational and Data Science for High Energy Physics (CoDaS-HEP) will take place on 10-13 July, 2017, at Princeton University.

  Advanced software
 
  The CoDaS-HEP
 
  Specific Topics to be covered at the school include:

  * Parallel Programming 
  * Big Data Tools and Techniques
  * Machine Learning 
  * Practical skills like performance evaluation, use of git, etc.

Large scientific projects such as those in High Energy Physics are critically
dependent on software and computing.
