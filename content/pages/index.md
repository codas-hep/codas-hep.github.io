#### The first school on tools, techniques and methods for Computational and Data Science for High Energy Physics (CoDaS-HEP) will take place on 10-13 July, 2017, at Princeton University.

Advanced software is a critical ingredient to scientific research. Training young researchers in the latest tools and techniques is an essential part of developing the skills required for a successful career both in research and in industry.

The CoDaS-HEP school aims to provide a broad introduction to these critical skills as well as an overview of applications High Energy Physics. Specific topics to be covered at the school include:
 
  Specific Topics to be covered at the school include:

  * Parallel Programming 
  * Big Data Tools and Techniques
  * Machine Learning - Technology and Methods
  * Practical skills: performance evaluation, use of git for version control

The school offers a limited number of young researchers an opportunity to learn these skills from experienced scientists and instructors. Successful applicants will receive travel and lodging support to attend the school.
