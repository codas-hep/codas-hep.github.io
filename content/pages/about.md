  The school on Computational and Data Science for High Energy Physics 
(CoDaS-HEP) was created to fill a void in the training of graduate students
and postdocs working in HEP. Training young researchers in the latest 
computational tools and techniques is essential to their future careers in 
both research and industry. To be successful todayâ€™s grad students require a 
mix of particle physics domain knowledge and advanced software skills. 
Relevant computing topics are however often missing from traditional physics 
coursework and, as young researchers begin their active research careers, 
they discover the need for these skills, but are no longer in a position to 
follow such courses.

  The school was intially developed in 2017-2018 as part of the NSF-funded 
[Parallel Kalman Filter Tracking project](http://trackreco.github.io), 
in particular through grants PHY-1520942, PHY-1520969, PHY-1521042 and 
ACI-1450377. The school is realized in partnership with the [Princeton 
Institute for Computational Science and Engineering (PICSciE)](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu). Building on the success of the
first iterations of the school, direct support will continue from 2019
through two other NSF-funded projects: [FIRST-HEP](http://first-hep.org)
and [IRIS-HEP](http://iris-hep.org). Additional collaborations 
have also been added (see list below).

  A dedicated compute platform (the CoDaS-HEP Platform) is also being 
developed by the [Enrico Fermi Institute](https://efi.uchicago.edu) at the 
University of Chicago to support the exercises portion of these training 
activities.
