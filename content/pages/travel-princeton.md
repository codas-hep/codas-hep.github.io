### General Notes

General information about traveling to and visiting Princeton University can be found on the ["visiting campus" webpages](http://www.princeton.edu/main/visiting/). 

Please send any questions about travel to Princeton to [codas-hep@googlegroups.com](codas-hep@googlegroups.com).


### Travel by Train

From Newark Liberty International (EWR) airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and from many other locations along the east coast (e.g. Boston, NYC, Washington DC and Baltimore), it is possible to travel to Princeton by train. 
Note that there are two train stations you will need to know:

  * The major train station closest to Princeton is ["Princeton Junction Station" (PJC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Junction_station). This is served by [New Jersey Transit](http://www.njtransit.com) on the ["Northeast Corridor Line"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Corridor_Line). PJC also has some limited service by Amtrak (to Washington DC, TBC).
  * The campus train station is ["Princeton Station"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_station_(NJ_Transit)). This is served only by a small commuter train (the "Dinky") which goes along a spur line from Princeton Junction Station to campus. It is operated by New Jersey Transit.

If you are coming from EWR, Trenton or NYC Penn Station, you should buy a New Jersey Transit ticket through to Princeton Station. You will then need to take a train to Princeton Junction train station (check that your particular train stops there!), get off at Princeton Junction train station and take the "Dinky" from Princeton Junction train station to Princeton train station.

If you are coming on Amtrak, most trains do not stop at Princeton Junction (with the exception of select trains from Washington DC). You will probably need to take Amtrak to Newark or Trenton and then switch to New Jersey Transit, as above, to arrive to Princeton Station on campus.

### Travel by Air

The closest and most convenient airport to come to Princeton is Newark Liberty International (EWR). Most participants will find that the simplest solution for domestic flights within the US. This is the recommended solution unless the cost is significantly higher than other solutions. From there it is possible to take the train as described above. 

Alternatively, flying to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) at the cost of additional travel time. From JFK, the easiest is probably to the Airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the [Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjp7enVi8LUAhVJbVAKHQzpBukQFggmMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mta.info%2Flirr&usg=AFQjCNFkOvv1hHfiREn_00NkjelXSbfiYQ) or to New York Penn Station. Alternatively there is the [subway](http://www.nysubway.com/airport/jfk.html) or a bus ([NYC Airporter](https://www.nycairporter.com) with service from JFK to NYC Penn Station. From NYC Penn Station, you can take the train to Princeton as described above.

From [a small number of locations](http://www.mercercounty.org/departments/transportation-and-infrastructure/trenton-mercer-airport/airlines) it may also be possible to fly to [Trenton-Mercer Airport](http://www.mercercounty.org/departments/transportation-and-infrastructure/trenton-mercer-airport). Getting from there to the Princeton campus is more complicated and involves buses and/or going to the train station in Trenton and taking New Jersey Transit trains, as above.

In general long distance taxis will be costly and should be avoided. Uber and Lyft should be possible on and around the Princeton campus (incl. Princeton Junction train station) at a modest price.

## Local Princeton Information

### Scully Hall

[Scully Hall](https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduates/explore/upperclass-dormitories/scully-hall) is an upperclass dormitory on the Princeton Campus. It is a 5-10 minute walk from the Princeton train station and a 5 minute walk from Jadwin Hall, where the school lectures will take place.

Keys to the dorm rooms can be picked up in a 2 hour window on 9 July (exact times will be defined and announced before that date). If you arrive outside that time window, the keys can be picked up at Public Safety, located at 200 Elm Drive and labeled "Guard Booth" on the [campus map](/images/Princeton-University-Map-CoDaS-HEP-2017.gif), very close to Scully Hall.

Note that linen and towels will be provided at Scully Hall, but participants should bring their own toiletries (shampoo, soap, etc.).

### Parking on campus

Parking is possible on the Princeton campus. The best place to park is in Lot 20, which is a 5 minute walk from Scully Hall (the dorm) and Jadwin Hall (the buildings where the school will take place) as indicated on this [campus map](/images/Princeton-University-Map-CoDaS-HEP-2017.gif). An overnight parking pass for Lot 20 will be given to participants staying in Scully Hall along with the room key.
