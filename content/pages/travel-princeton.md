### Travel to Princeton

General information about traveling to and visiting Princeton University can be found on the ["visiting campus" webpages](http://www.princeton.edu/main/visiting/). The closest and most conveniently accessed international airport is Newark Liberty International (EWR), although it is possible to reach Princeton from Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) at the cost of additional travel time.

From the airports and from many other locations, it is possible to travel to Princeton by train. The train station closest to Princeton is ["Princeton Junction" (PJC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Junction_station) (PJC). For New Jersey Transit you will be on the ["Northeast Corridor Line"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Corridor_Line), although Amtrak does have some limited service to PJC. From Princeton Junction train station you can take a taxi to the hotel (on Route 1) or to campus. It is also possible to take the "Dinky", a small train which makes its way along a spur line from Princeton Junction station to a small "Princeton" station.

### Parking on campus

Parking is possible on the Princeton campus. The best place to park (which should be free) is in Lot 21, which is a 10 minute walk from Jadwin Hall (the buildings where the meetings will take place) as indicated on this [campus map](images/13614-PU-map-lot21.jpg).
