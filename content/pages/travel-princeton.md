### General Notes

General information about traveling to and visiting Princeton University can be found on the ["visiting campus" webpages](http://www.princeton.edu/main/visiting/). 

Please send any questions about travel to Princeton to [codas-hep@googlegroups.com](codas-hep@googlegroups.com).


### Travel by Train

From Newark Liberty International (EWR) airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and from many other locations along the east coast (e.g. Boston, NYC, Washington DC and Baltimore), it is possible to travel to Princeton by train. 
Note that there are two train stations you will need to know:

  * The major train station closest to Princeton is ["Princeton Junction Station" (PJC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Junction_station). This is served by [New Jersey Transit](http://www.njtransit.com) on the ["Northeast Corridor Line"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Corridor_Line). PJC also has some limited direct service by Amtrak.
  * The campus train station is ["Princeton Station"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_station_(NJ_Transit)). This is served only by a small commuter train (the "Dinky") which goes along a spur line from Princeton Junction Station to campus. It is operated by New Jersey Transit.

If you are coming from EWR, Trenton or NYC Penn Station, you should buy a New Jersey Transit ticket through to Princeton Station. You will then need to take a train to Princeton Junction train station (check that your particular train stops there!), get off at Princeton Junction train station and take the "Dinky" from Princeton Junction train station to Princeton train station.

If you are coming on Amtrak, most trains do not stop at Princeton Junction (with only a few exceptions, see the [Amtrak website](http://amtrak.com)). You will probably need to take Amtrak to Newark or Trenton and then switch to New Jersey Transit, as above, to arrive to Princeton Station on campus.

### Travel by Air

The closest and most convenient airport to come to Princeton is Newark Liberty International (EWR). Most participants will find that the best solution for domestic flights within the US. This is the recommended airport unless the cost is significantly higher than other alternatives. From there it is convenient to take the train as described above. 

Another option is flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) at the cost of additional travel time. From JFK, the easiest is probably to the Airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the [Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjp7enVi8LUAhVJbVAKHQzpBukQFggmMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mta.info%2Flirr&usg=AFQjCNFkOvv1hHfiREn_00NkjelXSbfiYQ) or to New York Penn Station. Alternatively there is the [subway](http://www.nysubway.com/airport/jfk.html) or a bus ([NYC Airporter](https://www.nycairporter.com) with service from JFK to NYC Penn Station. From NYC Penn Station, you can take the train to Princeton as described above.

From [a small number of locations](http://www.mercercounty.org/departments/transportation-and-infrastructure/trenton-mercer-airport/airlines) it may also be possible to fly to [Trenton-Mercer Airport](http://www.mercercounty.org/departments/transportation-and-infrastructure/trenton-mercer-airport). Getting from there to the Princeton campus is more complicated and involves buses and/or going to the train station in Trenton and taking New Jersey Transit trains, as above.

In general long distance taxis will be costly and should be avoided. Uber and Lyft should be possible on and around the Princeton campus (incl. Princeton Junction train station) at a modest price.

## Local Princeton Information
