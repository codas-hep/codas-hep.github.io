### General Notes

General information about traveling to and visiting Princeton University can be found on the ["visiting campus" webpages](http://www.princeton.edu/main/visiting/).

Please send any questions about travel to Princeton to [codas-hep@googlegroups.com](codas-hep@googlegroups.com).

### Travel by Train

From Newark Liberty International (EWR) airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and from many other locations along the east coast (e.g. Boston, NYC, Washington DC and Baltimore), it is possible to travel to Princeton by train.
Note that there are two train stations you will need to know:

* The major train station closest to Princeton is ["Princeton Junction Station" (PJC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Junction_station). This is served by [New Jersey Transit](http://www.njtransit.com) on the ["Northeast Corridor Line"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Corridor_Line). PJC also has some limited direct service by Amtrak.
* The campus train station is ["Princeton Station"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_station_(NJ_Transit)). This is served only by a small commuter train (the "Dinky") which goes along a spur line from Princeton Junction Station to campus. It is operated by New Jersey Transit. 

If you are coming from EWR, Trenton or NYC Penn Station, you should buy a New Jersey Transit ticket through to Princeton Station. You will then need to take a train to Princeton Junction train station (check that your particular train stops there!), get off at Princeton Junction train station and take the "Dinky" from Princeton Junction train station to Princeton train station.

Check ["NJ Transit Travel Alerts and Advisories"](https://www.njtransit.com/travel-alerts-to) for the status of NJ Transit services.  Princeton Station and Princeton Junction are on the "Northeast Corridor" line.

If you are coming on Amtrak, most trains do not stop at Princeton Junction (with only a few exceptions, see the [Amtrak website](http://amtrak.com)). You will need to take Amtrak to Newark or Trenton and then switch to New Jersey Transit, as above, to arrive to Princeton Station on campus.

### Travel by Air

The closest and most convenient airport to come to Princeton is Newark Liberty International (EWR). Most participants will find that the best solution for domestic flights within the US. This is the recommended airport unless the cost is significantly higher than other alternatives. From there it is convenient to take the train as described above.

Another option is flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) at the cost of additional travel time. From JFK, the easiest is probably to the Airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the [Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)](https://new.mta.info/agency/long-island-rail-road) or to New York Penn Station. Alternatively there is the [subway](http://www.nysubway.com/airport/jfk.html) or a bus ([NYC Airporter](https://www.nycairporter.com) with service from JFK to NYC Penn Station. From NYC Penn Station, you can take the train to Princeton as described above.

<!--
From [a small number of locations](http://www.mercercounty.org/departments/transportation-and-infrastructure/trenton-mercer-airport/airlines) it may also be possible to fly to [Trenton-Mercer Airport](http://www.mercercounty.org/departments/transportation-and-infrastructure/trenton-mercer-airport). Getting from there to the Princeton campus is more complicated and involves buses and/or going to the train station in Trenton and taking New Jersey Transit trains, as above.
-->

In general long distance taxis will be costly and should be avoided. Uber and Lyft should be possible on and around the Princeton campus (incl. Princeton Junction train station) at a modest price.

## Local Princeton Information

### Accommodation - Butler College or Bloomberg Hall on the Princeton campus

Participants will reside in dorm rooms provided in [Butler College](https://butlercollege.princeton.edu) on the Princeton campus or in [Bloomberg Hall](https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/bloomberg-hall).
They are a 10 minute walk from the [Princeton (Dinky) train station](https://www.njtransit.com/dinky) and a 5 minute walk from Lewis Library, where the school lectures will take place.

Information coming soon regarding check-in and dorm key pickup on Sunday, 21 July, 2024, is coming soon...

<!--
Check-in and dorm key pickup is possible from 2:00-6:00 pm on 
Sunday, 16 July, 2023 directly at Wendell Hall, Whitman College.
If arriving after 6:00 pm, go tp Public Safety at 200 Elm Drive (near Whitman 
College) to pick up the dorm key.

If you are arriving for some reason by Uber/Lyft/Car share, the best drop off 
point to get to Wendell Hall is probably at the campus [Princeton (Dinky) Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_station_(NJ_Transit)).
-->

Bedsheets, blankets, and pillows will be provided.

<!--
**Dorm check-in and key pickup:** On Sunday, 31 July, you can pick-up your dorm key at Baker Hall between 12:00 and 16:00. If you arrive after 16:00 you will
need to go to Public Safety to pick up your key. (See the 
[annotated Campus Map](/downloads/CoDaS-HEP-2022-PUCampusMap.pdf).)

**Dorm check-out and key drop-off:** To check out of the dorms you only need 
to do two things: (1) vacate the room before 17:00 EDT on Friday and 
(2) drop-off the key. Three scenarios regarding key drop-off:

  * You are leaving early on Friday morning and not attending the Friday morning school sessions: you will need to leave the key with Public Safety or leave the key with another school participant to drop-off.
  * You are coming to the school sessions on Friday morning and will bring your luggage with you to Jadwin Hall (we can put things along the wall outside the lecture room): you can bring the key to the check-in desk for the school outside JJadwin 407 and leave it with us.
  * You are coming to the school sessions on Friday morning, but would like to leave your things in the dorm until after the school sessions end (possible as long as you vacate before 17:00 EDT), you will need to leave the key with Public Safety.

If this isn't clear, please ask!
-->

<!--
Keys are available for pick up at our office of Public Safety, 200 Elm Drive, open 24 hours, seven days a week. Participants will receive a hotel style key in a packet with the room number at Public Safety. To enter the building, hold the key up to the black box on the building. To enter the room, hold the key in front of the key pad on your room door.

A linen packet is provided in the room and includes sheets, towels, a pillow and blanket. Bedrooms are private, though bathrooms are shared with one other person.
