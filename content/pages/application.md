The third school on tools, techniques and methods for Computational and Data Science for High Energy Physics (CoDaS-HEP) took place on 22-26 July, 2019, at Princeton University.

The application period for the CoDaS-HEP 2019 school is now over. The deadline for application was 7 May, 2019. 

  We had originally planned for a new edition of the school in summer, 2020,
however COVID-19 restrictions do not permit us to run an in-person event as
planned. Please watch for announcements in early 2021, regarding the 2021 
edition of the CoDaS-HEP school.
